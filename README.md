# Cloud-based-ECG
In this project, the main objective is to develop an Electrocardiograph monitoring device that will be connected to a cloud platform. The ECG is read from a person using electrodes connected to the arms & legs and then amplified using the instrumentational amplifier. It is then digitized using an analog to digital converter and fed into the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the signal and sends relevant information to the remote server. This involves developing a hardware architecture to measure ECG signals, the internet of things and embedded systems to carry out signals from analog circuits to the cloud platform.
